# A-communication-system-for-fall-detect.ion
This project consists of realizing a communication system for fall detection based on LoRa technology and using the STM32F103 development board. The device sends alerts containing. the location detected by a GSM / GPRS module. Indeed, during a fall, a LoRa packet which contains the coordinates of the location will be sent to a gateway. This gateway will then transfer this data to an IoT “ThingSpeak” server connected to a graphical interface . On the other hand, an SMS will be sent to ensure the transfer of the alert.
